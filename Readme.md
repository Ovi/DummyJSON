# DummyJSON

[DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com) is a free online REST API that you can use whenever you need some placeholder data for your front-end website or single-page application without running any server-side code.
It's awesome for teaching purposes, sample codes, testing, prototyping.

Checkout the detailed docs at [DummyJSON/Docs](https://dummyjson.com/docs/) for samples.

## Why?

Most of the time when we create a front-end application or website for learning or for client, we have to rely on the backend to implement the front-end or if we want to create a simple learning application we have to use hard-coded data, recently I found myself in need of some data.

I didn't like the idea of using some public API because I had the feeling that I was spending more time registering a client and understanding a complex API than focusing on my task.

So I decided to code a simple backend server that solved my problem, and here's DummyJSON.

You can find it running here and are free to use it in your developments and prototypes: https://dummyjson.com.

I hope you will find it useful.
